<h3>hacker - Binary, Web, Mobile, Infrastructure, Cloud and Active Directory</h3>


> "...and you will know my name, by the trail of the dead."


Yo! I'm **th3_0ccupi3r** also known as **t0** I convert assumptions into exploits. The world is brittle; I’m just the inevitable pressure. I break whatever I can touch: web apps, mobile apps, binaries, servers, appliances, hardware. If it talks, I make it confess. If it won’t talk, I ***MAKE*** it talk. Chaining low-risk faults into a reliable exploit is my art. I laugh at bad security.

I live for horror movies and heavy riffs (black metal/death metal/extreme metal/metalcore/numetal etc) **\m/**

### What I do (sharp and to the point... like a Bowie Knife)
**Web Apps**: Recon, fuzzing, deep dives into logic and JavaScript shenanigans. I live for server-side issues (especially RCEs 😈). I’m also a big fan of finding open-source products lurking in your attack surface and tearing them apart, piece by piece.

**Mobile Apps**: This started when I realised most mobile apps are just fancy wrappers around web apps. Now I’m hooked on static analysis (Ghidra, JADX, JADGUI) and dynamic analysis with Frida — crafting scripts to break things in style. It’s been fun bridging the gap between binary and web 🕹️

**Binary Exploitation**: Got my start during OSCE prep, and now I’m sharpening my exploit-fu with ROP chains and heap overflows. Painful but oddly satisfying.

**Source Code Review**: There’s something deeply satisfying about sleuthing through code and uncovering sneaky, overlooked bugs. A bit like treasure hunting, but with more if statements.

**Fuzzing**: Making things crash with boofuzz, AFL++, Hongfuzz & Radamsa... and then manually triaging the chaos (for now 🧪).

**Infrastructure & AD**: Credential Reuse, Relay Attacks, ADCS misconfigs, Kerberoasting, AS-REP roasting — you name it. Sorry, SOC teams… nothing personal 😅

Feel free to take a look around here, just don't expect to find anything private uploaded here 😉
